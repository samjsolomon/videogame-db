# Project Description

Using the SDLC, this database was designed to help bob organize his video game store.

Bob owns a video game store that needs some organization. He has many games with different categories, prices, ratings, and publishers. Bob loves to know all the information about his games. He makes sure he has facts about the publisher stored. He keeps publisher information like who the founders are and where they have their headquarters. Each game has only one publisher. Bob also keeps tracks of his customers. He saves their email, phone number, name, and birthdate. If the customer is under 18, they can’t buy a game that’s rated R. Bob keeps track of all his orders with order numbers and records of which customer made the order, the items bought, and the calculated total price. He also has to keep track of his employees. They each have names, job titles, and salaries. This database is designed to keep Bob's store organized
and help him easily find out information like:

  - What action games are in the store? 
  - Does Bob own Minecraft for Xbox?
  -  What games by Notch does Bob own?
  -   What games are under 20$?
   - Which games are R-rated?
  - Can Susan buy her favorite R-rated game?
 - How much does Alan get paid?
  - Where is the Bethesda headquarters?
  -  What was the total for Susan's last order?
